# hello-world
My first reposition

Hello, I am glad you bothered to even come here and read this. I do not have anything to say about myself. I wish I knew more about myself to tell you guys, but I feel I don't know much about myself in the first place. It is either because I am way too complicated or just way too simple (I think it's the latter one). This turned out to be stupid. Hopefully, I'll be able to write something more interesting later on and completely transform this so that nobody sees this weird sentences.
